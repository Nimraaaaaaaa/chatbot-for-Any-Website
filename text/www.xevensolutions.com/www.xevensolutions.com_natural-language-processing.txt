NLP model development process 







 



 



							Step 1						



Define the Problem and Gather Data
 



Identifying the issue that the model is intended to answer is the first step in creating an NLP model. This entails determining the exact task that the model is intended to carry out, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or machine translation.  







 



							Step 2						



 



Choose a Model Architecture and Train it 



Select an appropriate model architecture, such as a recurrent neural network, convolutional neural network, or transformer model, and train it on the prepared data. During training, the model is exposed to large amounts of labeled text data and adjusts its parameters to minimize the loss function. 







 



							Step 3						



 



Evaluate the Model Performance
 



After the model training its performance must be tested on a different test set. Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and perplexity are frequent evaluation criteria for NLP tasks. 







 



							Step 4						



Deploy the Model 



The model can be used in a production context after it has been trained and assessed. This entails putting the model, along with any required pre- or post-processing activities, into a software program or API.
