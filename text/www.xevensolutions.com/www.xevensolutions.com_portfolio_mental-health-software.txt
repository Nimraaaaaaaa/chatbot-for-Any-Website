Effective AI Chatbots For Better Consultation Services 



							Like physical health, mental health is a spectrum on which all individuals rely for optimal functioning and productivity. Most individuals today are wrapped up in a web of stress, burnout, and illnesses like depression or anxiety, depending on what circumstances they are facing. All of these mental health issues are linked to changes in the social construct that surround us. Several  mental health software companies have come forward lately to offer their services in relevant fields.						







Major advances in science and technology have paved the way for patients to access mental health resources. As indicated by worrisome mental health statistics, mental health is a big concern in the United States. Unfortunately, everything related to mental health is stigmatized. This is why easy access to affordable mental health resources is so important.Some of the most well-known web application development companies in the United States have taken initiatives to ensure the mental well-being of their employees as well. Many apps have been developed to counter the aftermath of anxiety-related issues. Research shows that in 2017-2018, 9.7 percent of adolescents in the United States had severe major depression, and 60 percent of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health therapy. The development of mental health EHR software has facilitated patient care and data management to a great extent.Telehealth services for mental healthWhen using mobile health applications, treatment for one’s mental wellness may take place anywhere and at any time, making this an extremely convenient option for therapy. If a patient has difficulty getting an in-person visit, a mobile health app can be useful whether somebody needs treatment in the middle of the night or while traveling to work.Increased engagement ratesAnother advantage of mobile health applications is their high engagement rates. Patients are seldom utilizing their mobile applications under therapeutic supervision, which implies they are encouraged to utilize these apps on their own rather than following therapist directions. Furthermore, the use of prompts, real-time involvement, and game-like interactions can all lead to increased engagement.Real time audio/video consultationsMental health apps allow live audio/visual sessions with licensed, experienced health practitioners. The mental apps often function through synchronous chat systems with AI chatbots for interaction and patient queries. Some examples include Calm, Mood fit, and Talk space etc.Not all people suffering from severe symptoms can benefit from mental health applications or mobile treatment, but for those suffering from moderate symptoms, having access to 24/7, round-the-clock care can be beneficial. This is particularly useful since it allows people in various time zones to seek mental healthcare when and when it is not available locally.At Xeven we offer quality care mental health app development services. Equipped with the latest tech our telehealth experts are available all the time. We engage in a mental health management system that is inclusive of mental health EHR software. Connect with us to avail outstanding services like never before.
