Top 5 Best AI voice changers1: Murf AI2: Altered3: Speechify4: Eleven Labs5: MyEditConclusion:
Recording a voiceover with professional-sounding audio is not as easy as you might think, especially if you don’t have access to a studio. 
Rehearsals consume a significant amount of time, and the final product often ends up with background noise. 
As it does for everything right now, artificial intelligence provides a solution with AI voice changers, helping users edit unwanted parts of pre-recorded audio and modify voices in real time.
 Whether you want to try your hand at becoming the next Mel Blanc or need to speed up the process of recording your podcast, here’s a rundown of some of the best AI voice changers.
Top 5 Best AI voice changers

1: Murf AI
Murf AI is the best AI voice changer free online in the market, offering realistic voices in 20 different languages and various dialects. Users can also clone the voice of their choice and adjust speed, pitch, and tone of voice. 
Best of all, it allows you to mute a part of your voiceover, trim the audio, and even alternate the pronunciation of the words. The emphasis features enables the user to add extra force to a phrase or certain word. 
Its free version lets the users generate 10 minutes of voiceover. However, these audio files can’t be downloaded, and the quality of free text-to-speech voices is not up to mark. 
Pros

Multilingual support
Audio and text input support
Multiple voice styles
Customization of AI voice

Cons

Not suitable for live streaming and gaming
Low voice quality
Downloading and exporting projects are not available for free plan

Pricing Options:

It offers the widest range of features, including real-time morphing, rapid voice creation, post-production morphing, and audio editing. 
Altered also has many customization options, allowing the users to generate the perfect voice for their requirements. 
Despite its extensive collection of AI voices in multiple languages, the final voice output is a little noisy. The platform’s interface is not user-friendly, and tweaking the pitch resulted in robotic output. 
Its free plan is limited and offers only 5-minute-long real-time voices per month plus 3-minute voice morphing per month. 
Pros

Customizable voice modulation
Seamless integration with audio and video software
Variety of narration styles

Cons

3: Speechify

Speechify can turn your text into an output that sounds like a professional voice actor. Best known for producing human-like cadence, Speechify has more than 200 voices in 20 different languages and accents to choose from. 
It can seamlessly convert emails, docs, PDFs, and website articles into audible audio, allowing users to listen to their required documents instead of reading them. 
It gives you control over speed, tone, and pitch as you paste the script and start generating AI voices. 
Furthermore, you can also set pauses at different parts of the audio and include custom pronunciation. 
The best part? Speechify also lets you add your voice to generate a soundtrack using your own voice. 
Pros

Customization options for voiceovers
Cross-platform compatibility
200 voices in 20 languages

Cons

Fast reading speed
A subscription is needed to access advanced features

Price Options:

Free Plan ($0.00)
Premium Plan ($11.58/month)

4: Eleven Labs
One of the impressive voice changer AI is Eleven Labs, with a huge library of over 300 natural-sounding voices and AI-powered voices of celebrities. 
It stands ahead of the competition, with a library boasting over 10,000 community voices and more than 50 pre-made voices. 
You can filter community voices by use cases such as advertisement, conversational, narrative, and more. 
Free plans offer 10 minutes of audio per month, while premium plans offer 30 minutes of audio along with many other advanced features. 
Its natural-sounding voice outputs and hundreds of realistic voices in multiple languages make it a go-to choice for audiobook artists, YouTubers, and content creators seeking professional-grade audio quality.

Less language support than other voice changer tools

Starter Plan ($5/month)
Creator Plan($11/month)
Pro Plan($99/month)
Scale Plan($330/month)
Enterprise Plan($1,320/month)
