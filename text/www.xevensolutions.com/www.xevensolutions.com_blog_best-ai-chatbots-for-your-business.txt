AI chatbot development has seen significant adoption over the years. It is because of the benefits AI chatbots have to offer to businesses. However, it is essential to know that different types of AI chatbots serve different purposes. 
Not every type of chatbot will play the same role in accelerating your business growth. This is because each business has its own objectives and challenges. Some businesses want to enhance customer support, while others want to generate leads for them. The question here arises: how to choose the right AI chatbot for the business?
Today, we will be discussing different types of AI chatbots and their functionality to help you choose what best suits your business. But before that, let’s have a brief introduction to AI chatbots, how chatbots work, and learn some interesting stats about them.
What are AI chatbots?

AI chatbots are software solutions programmed to engage users via text or voice. These AI chatbots engage in human-like conversations utilizing natural language processing and artificial intelligence algorithms. 
They understand user queries and provide relevant responses based on the training data. They are mainly used across websites, mobile applications, messaging platforms, etc., to provide better customer support. According to Relay, 58% of B2B companies employ AI chatbots on their website, while 42% on B2C websites.
How does an AI chatbot work?
AI chatbots utilize several cutting-edge technologies, including natural language processing and machine learning algorithms. We can divide how chatbots work into simpler steps:

The conversation starts when a user types in a message or speaks to a chatbot using the user interface.
Chatbots are programmed to understand the user message by recognizing the keywords to provide the most relevant answer using the NLP technique. 
To respond, chatbots search their database for the most relevant answer.
After successfully finding the most relevant answer, the chatbot responds to the user, which can be seen on the user interface.
The conversation keeps going till the user decides to end it.

It is interesting to note that chatbots keep track of the previous conversation and smartly provide responses according to the context.
