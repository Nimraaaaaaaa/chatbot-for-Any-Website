Big organizations like Meta, Google, OpenAI, and others are racing to launch their AI models with extraordinary capabilities. They have introduced several free and paid models, such as Meta AI, Gemini, ChatGPT, and more.
These models can benefit businesses in various ways. They streamline customer support by integrating ChatGPT with WhatsApp. This is just one of the numerous benefits of using ChatGPT on WhatsApp business. These AI models empower not only companies but also individuals.
Recently, OpenAI has demonstrated its dominance over rivals in the AI field by launching its latest model, GPT-4o. The main benefit of this AI model GPT-4o is that it brings powerful reasoning, processing, and natural language abilities to the free version of ChatGPT for the first time. 
Haven’t you heard about it yet? Don’t worry. In this article, we will explore what GPT-4o is, what makes it unique from others, and more exciting things about it.
What is GPT-4o?

GPT-4o is a multimodal AI model that can carry out human-like conversations. Many people wonder what the “o” stands for. Is it some kind of marketing gimmick? No, it isn’t just a marketing stunt. The “o” in GPT-4o stands for Omni, reflecting the model’s multimodal capabilities.
Users can input texts, voice, images, and even videos, and the AI model responds to them with text, voice, or images. It understands user sentiments and keeps the context in mind to provide more accurate responses.
It can respond to audio inputs in a lightning-fast 232 ms, with an average response time of just 320 ms—mirroring the speed of human conversation and making interactions feel incredibly natural. Moreover, it can recognize objects and images in real-time more accurately. 
The owners made it clear that it would be available to everyone but would offer five times more efficiency to paid users.
Key Aspects that Sets GPT-4o Apart
You might already know that GPT-4o isn’t the first update to GPT-4. OpenAI introduced GPT-4 Turbo with enhanced capabilities in November 2023. AI enthusiasts and intriguing minds must be thinking about what makes GPT-4o unique from earlier GPT-4 versions. Here are some key things about the AI model GPT-4o:
1. Multimodal Integration
According to the CTO of OpenAI, Mira Murati, GPT-4o stands out due to its ability to handle various input types simultaneously. Unlike earlier models, which primarily focused on text, GPT-4o can interpret and generate audio, images, and videos.
2. Enhanced Capabilities
GPT-4o matches the impressive text, reasoning, and coding abilities of GPT-4 Turbo. What sets it apart is its exceptional performance in multilingual, audio, and visual tasks. Murati said that GPT-4o responds much faster than earlier models. It makes interactions feel more natural.
3. Supports 50+ Languages
Murati said that this model not only enhances quality and speed but supports 50 different languages. It makes it such a powerful tool and easily accessible for global users to benefit from its capabilities.
4. Model Safety
Safety is built into GPT-4o’s design, with robust systems to filter training data and refine model behavior. This includes extensive external evaluations and red teaming to identify and mitigate risks across various modalities.
GPT-4o Availability

GPT-4o is available for most of the users globally. However, this model might not have the full features. The complete features will be rolled out iteratively.
According to OpenAI, GPT-4o’s text and image features have been added to all versions of ChatGPT. However, the free version users have limited message limits, while ChatGPT Plus users will have up to five times more message limits. 
In the coming weeks, a new Voice Mode with GPT-4o will also be introduced in alpha for ChatGPT Plus users.
How to access GPT-4o for free?
The first thing you will notice when returning to your AI assistant, ChatGPT, is that its address is changed from chat.openai.com to chatgpt.com. You must log in to your ChatGPT account using a web browser.
1. For Free Version Users


Once logged in, free users will see the following screen, on which, at the top left corner, they can see the version they are using. 
The free version will have limited access to GPT-4o features. Users can start a chat to get more accurate responses from the latest version. However, it is noteworthy that you can only input a limited number of messages daily. Once the limit is exceeded, you will be shifted to using the ChatGPT-3.5.
Users with the free version can now upload items from desktop devices and communicate with the AI model.

2. For Users with Paid Version


Users with a paid version of ChatGPT can also access the model GPT-4o via the web. However, they will see various model options at the top left corner of their screen. They can choose the model of their choice to start a conversation with the AI model. 
Paid users have access to the complete features of the GPT-4o. They have no limits on the number of texts and can enjoy unlimited conversion with the best version of ChatGPT.
You can also upload files to analyze and later ask questions about the content discussed in the file.

3. API and Desktop Access
GPT-4o can be accessed using OpenAI’s API and desktop application. If you are a developer looking to enhance the performance and capabilities of your applications, you can seamlessly integrate it into your applications.
OpenAI is making AI more accessible and easy to use on different platforms. On May 13, they launched a new app for Apple’s macOS. This app integrates GPT-4o directly into macOS, giving developers and users a powerful tool at their fingertips.
Difference between GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o
Here is a comparison between GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, and the latest GPT-4o to understand their performance abilities.

Ethical Concerns Raised with the Introduction of GPT-4o

Even before the introduction of the GPT-4o AI model, we’ve seen the negative impacts of technological advancements, such as the creation of deep fakes. Some people misuse these AI models to generate convincing fake news or misleading content.
The advancements in AI will give rise to many new cyber criminals. It is crucial to ensure that security protocols are followed to protect sensitive data or information against these threats.

Conclusion
The introduction of GPT-4o marks a significant shift in the landscape of AI chatbots. With its ability to handle text, audio, images, and video inputs, GPT-4o sets new standards. It will transform the communication between chatbots and humans, making communication more realistic. It is 2X faster and 50% cheaper than its previous version (GPT-4 Turbo). Businesses must leverage ChatGPT integrations to streamline their processes and continue to grow. The best part of this innovation is that it will be available to everyone.
