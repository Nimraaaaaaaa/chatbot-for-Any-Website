If you are surfing the internet to understand different types of EMR systems, it hints that you already have a basic understanding of EMR software solutions. If that’s the case, in this article, we will only skim the surface of “what is an EMR” and will jump directly into the core topic of understanding multiple EMR types and why it is so important to invest in the right one for your practice.
What is an electronic medical record (EMR) system?
Electronic medical records (EMRs) are digital versions of patient paper charts that are introduced so that providers can quickly access and share accurate and up-to-date patient medical information with other providers. 
These EMRs contain patient medical history, medications, treatment plans, allergies, laboratory results, and more. The software used to store and manage these EMRs is known as the EMR system.
What are the different types of EMR systems?
There are numerous types of EMR systems depending on deployment method and specialty. In order to maximize your business efficiency and return on investment, it is crucial to understand the different EMR types. It helps you better understand what suits your healthcare organization the most and what returns to expect with EMR software implementation. 
So, without wasting much time, let’s explore the main types of EMR software:

 
1. Deployment-based EMR Systems
1.1 On-Premise EMRs
An on-premise EMR system, as the name indicates, is stored on the healthcare providers’ server within a healthcare environment. It is best suited for larger healthcare organizations as they can afford upfront costs and have the necessary resources to handle challenges.
Benefits of On-Premise EMR Systems

Improves data security and reduces the risks of cyber attacks
Provides complete control over EMRs
No reliance on the internet that enhances performance

Cons of On-Premise EMR Systems

Higher upfront costs
Require a full-time IT team for continuous updates 
Can lead to downtimes due to hardware failure

1.2 Cloud-Based EMRs
In cloud-based EMR solutions, patient health information is stored and accessed from remote servers instead of local servers. It accesses the patient data using the internet. This type of EMR system is most suitable for startups and small to midsize healthcare practices.
Benefits of Cloud-Based EMR Systems

Lower initial costs as no extensive hardware is required
Can scale easily with growing organization needs
Provide convenience in accessing health information

Cons of Cloud-Based EMR Systems

Increase the risks of cyber attacks
Limited control over data storage locations and management
An internet outrage can result in operational disruptions

2. Specialty-based EMR systems
2.1 Specialty-Specific EMRs
Specialty-specific EMR systems are developed after understanding your specific practice and its requirements for maximum impact. Suppose you are running a cardiology practice; it’s necessary to have an EMR solution tailored to tackle the unique challenges of the cardiology specialty rather than a general solution. These custom EMR solutions come with pre-built templates and workflows.
Benefits of Specialty-Specific EMR Systems

Tailored to meet your specialty-specific needs
Offer templates and automate various processes for better productivity
Help to improve patient outcomes with features specifically designed for the specialty

Cons of Specialty-Specific EMR Systems

Can be costly due to high customization
Limited flexibility
Integration with other systems is complex

2.2 Multi-Specialty EMRs
If you want an EMR system that supports multiple specialties, then you must choose multi-specialty EMRs. Such versatile EMR systems have multiple templates and modules that are best suited for organizations that manage various specialties. These types of EMR software are all-in-one solutions that improve efficiency and care coordination.
Benefits of Multi-Specialty EMR Systems

Offer modules and features to support diverse medical specialties
Support better coordination among different departments and specialties
Allow organizations to expand specialties without the need for a new system

Cons of Multi-Specialty EMR Systems

Staff requires extensive training to utilize the system to maximum capacity
Maintenance costs are higher
Customization can be a challenge as it requires resources and time

3 Top Reasons to Invest in EMR Software Now
You’re probably questioning yourself: Should you invest in EMR systems? What benefits will you get with EMR software implementation? Isn’t it so?  Well, it’s totally fine. These questions come in every curious business mind. I will help you understand why you need an EMR system for your medical practice. Here are the top three benefits of EMR software implementation:

1. Better Patient Outcomes
EMRs help healthcare providers achieve better patient outcomes. It is because of a number of reasons. Starting with data management and retrieval. EMRs centralize patient data in a single place and make it easier to access. It helps in timely and informed decision-making without wasting much time.
It also supports care coordination as providers can share patient health information among multiple caregivers within a single practice. It helps teams to stay on the same page and deliver outstanding patient care.
EMR implementation significantly reduces medical errors and drug interactions. The reason? E-prescription generation and built-in feature to detect drug interactions, allergies, and vital signs to make data-driven decisions. So, at this point, I am guessing that you have found your answer to the question, “Do EMRs improve quality of care?”

2. Improve Operational Efficiency
Another benefit of the implementation of EMR systems is that they increase operational efficiency by automating various hectic and time-consuming tasks. It automates data entry, appointment scheduling, billing, and many other tasks. This automation helps to improve productivity and keep your business running smoothly.
Moreover, as discussed above, all data is stored digitally to make access easier. It helps to reduce time spent on finding patient health records and contributes to quicker patient turnaround.
3. Increase Profitability
If you have read till now and found nothing special about different types of EMR systems, no worries, as you surely are going to love how they improve profitability. 
EMRs help reduce common billing errors that help providers get paid accurately and quickly for serving patients. These systems do so by automatically gathering accurate patient data at the time of registration and submitting claims without delays.
Moreover, EMR software solutions provide detailed reports on finances that help business owners understand incoming and outgoing money. It helps with budgeting and identifying areas to generate more revenue and gain financial stability.
Conclusion
In today’s highly competitive and digitized healthcare landscape, it is impossible for any business to thrive without having a secure EMR solution. It is crucial to know that different types of EMR systems are available, each suitable for a specific purpose, and understanding every kind is necessary to make informed decisions. You can make the most of your EMR investment by aligning it with your specific needs and selecting the best EMR system.
