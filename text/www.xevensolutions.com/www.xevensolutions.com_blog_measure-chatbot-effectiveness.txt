But, if you are new to the concept, you might be wondering, what is an AI chatbot? Let’s dive in and have a brief introduction.
What are AI Chatbots?

Top 10 Chatbot Performance Metrics to Analyze Performance
It is necessary to analyze your chatbot’s performance, whether it is the ethical use of chatbot in mental healthcare or education. It helps business owners to continuously improve their performance. Here are the top 10 chatbot evaluation metrics to consider:
1: Bot Triggers
Bot triggers show the number of visitors who got a greeting message from the bot. It indicates that your bot is positioned right and is catching visitors’ eyes. Analyzing these triggers helps you know what is going well and what needs to be improved for users to see your bot and use it.  
2: Target Audience Engagement
It is one of the most critical metrics in the chatbot evaluation checklist. This metric provides pivotal insights about achieving your goals by focusing on the number of unique visitors engaging with your bot. It helps assess whether the bot effectively reaches your targeted audience and how frequently they interact with it.
3: Chatbot Activity Volume
Talking about the chatbot performance metrics and not including chatbot activity volume would overlook a crucial aspect of evaluating its effectiveness. 
Chatbot performance can be evaluated by measuring the number of interactions it makes with users within a specified time. This AI evaluation metric helps to know how actively users are engaging with your chatbot and whether its responses are relevant, which will increase user satisfaction and the number of users.
4: Bounce Rate
You can think of the bounce rate as the percentage of students who enter the class and leave even before the lecture begins. Regarding chatbots, the bounce rate indicates the number of users who left the chatbot without completing their intended task. 
A high bounce rate shows that the chatbot is not responding with relevant answers or that another issue is affecting the user experience.
5: Retention Rate
Retention rate indicates the proportion of users interacting with your chatbot multiple times within a specific timeframe. It provides insights into how well your chatbot responds to user queries that keep them coming back.
The retention rate and the bounce rate are inversely related. It means the higher the retention rate, the lower the bounce rate. 
6: Message Click-Through Rate

The message click-through rate (CTR) is one of the most crucial chatbot performance metrics. It indicates the percentage of users that have reached a specific message in the conversation with the chatbot.
Tracking this metric helps you know where in the conversational workflow you need improvement to make sure people reach the end of the conversation and convert to sales. A higher CTR means a better conversational flow for your AI chatbot.

7: Messages Exchange Rate (Interaction Rate)
The interaction rate is another pivotal factor in measuring the effectiveness of AI chatbots. It indicates the average number of messages exchanged per conversation between the AI chatbot and the user. A higher interaction rate suggests greater user involvement and interest. 
8: Self-Service Rate
This AI evaluation refers to the number of visitors whose queries are resolved by interacting with the chatbot without requiring further human support. A higher self-service rate signifies the bot’s ability to provide comprehensive solutions independently. Moreover, this metric lets you know if your investment is yielding returns and your client satisfaction is increasing. 
9: Non-Response Rate
The non-response rate is one of the most used chatbot performance metrics among businesses seeking to enhance user engagement. It measures the percentage of user queries to which the chatbot fails to provide an answer. It highlights areas where the bot may need improvement in understanding user input or accessing relevant information.
10: Goal Completion Rate
The last metric that makes it to our AI chatbot evaluation checklist is the goal completion rate. If your chatbot is assigned some specific task, then this metric allows you to track the success rate of that specific action when users interact with your chatbot. The actions can be filling out the form, booking an appointment, making a purchase, etc.
Conclusion
Understanding these chatbot performance metrics is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of AI chatbots in serving their intended purpose and meeting user expectations. However, these top 10 chatbot evaluation metrics may not be equally effective for every organization. You have to choose what suits your business best and helps you achieve your objectives.
