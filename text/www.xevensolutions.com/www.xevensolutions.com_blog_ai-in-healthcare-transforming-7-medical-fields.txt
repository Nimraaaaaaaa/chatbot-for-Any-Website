What is AI in Healthcare?

Artificial intelligence is a technology that allows machines to simulate human cognition. It enables them to learn and make better decisions when carrying out a task. So, in this respect, AI in healthcare means using smart machines to enhance healthcare professionals’ productivity. It automates the healthcare workflows and improves patient care. 
But the question here is how machines learn and carry out healthcare processes precisely. The use of robust technologies like machine learning, natural language processing, and other technologies allows machines and robots to learn and enhance healthcare delivery.
3 Top Real-World Examples & Use Cases of AI in Healthcare

AI use cases in healthcare have benefits for both patients and doctors. Let’s discuss how AI is used in healthcare to understand its potential. Here are some AI applications in healthcare that are reshaping the industry:
1.Electronic Health Records Management
There are several reasons for integrating EHR into business operations. It enhances patient care and streamlines administrative workflows. However, AI technology in healthcare helps to realize the maximum potential of EHRs by managing them efficiently.
Artificial intelligence empowers medical professionals to understand vast amounts of patient data and identify patterns to detect and treat diseases proactively. Let’s take an example of a diabetic patient. 
Healthcare professionals can analyze their past treatments, disease history, and genetics to know what diseases they are more prone to and can make strategies to prevent those risks. Moreover, it helps doctors to know a patient’s specific drug allergies and suggest tailored medication.
2.Remote Patient Monitoring
Won’t you like to get organizational tasks done from the ease of home? Whether you are a student who wants to learn or an employee who has to meet deadlines, don’t you prefer remote opportunities? How about enhancing patient consultations and monitoring with remote technology? AI in healthcare has made it possible and reinvented how we live and work.
Remote patient monitoring and telemedicine apps are healthcare trends that have seen notable adoption in recent years. Patients can quickly and conveniently consult their doctors, regardless of location. Moreover, they can share their reports and receive recommendations online.
Let’s take an example of a patient suffering from asthma. Several AI-powered wearable technologies are available that are synchronized with mobile apps. These wearables can measure the peak expiratory flow rate to know whether the lungs are working optimally. This data is accessible to the caretaker to provide better patient care.
3.Automating Administrative Tasks
One of the most common applications of AI in healthcare is automating administrative tasks. Have you ever wondered how much time it takes to complete all the paperwork and tedious tasks in a hospital? 
According to Forbes, physicians spend two-thirds of their time on paperwork. They spend 49.2% of their time doing paperwork and only 27% of their time taking care of patients. AI has taken away all the hassle of paperwork and appointment scheduling.
This automation in the medical field helps doctors to focus on high-quality healthcare delivery. Moreover, it reduces costs and frees healthcare professionals to improve patient outcomes.
