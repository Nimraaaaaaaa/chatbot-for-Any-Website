Would you like it if one of your trusted persons shared your secret with someone else? You might not appreciate it. Patients feel the same way about their data privacy in healthcare. They don’t want their personal information to be disclosed to unauthorized persons. 
In this digital age, healthcare data security is now more challenging than ever. It is because of the adoption of modern healthcare technologies that better serve people’s health needs. These technologies include electronic medical records (EMRs), telemedicine, wearable health devices, etc.
These healthcare technologies store patient data digitally for quick access and share among different healthcare providers for coordinated care. The digital footprint of patient health records, while convenient, exposes sensitive data to significant cyber threats. According to Statista, there are 3205 data compromise cases that have impacted over 353 million individuals in the US.
In this article, we will delve deeper into the importance of data security in healthcare, its top challenges, and the solutions to protect patient records.
What is healthcare data security?
Healthcare data security is the process of securing protected health information (PHI) from unauthorized access, disclosure, or use. The core aim is to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of healthcare data.
Securing data is just part of the task; it also involves protecting the computers and networks used in the healthcare ecosystem. HIPAA and GDPR compliance ensures the protection of all these elements against possible cyberattacks. 
Why is data security in healthcare important?
Healthcare data security is of great importance to patients and healthcare providers. It helps providers secure sensitive patient records against data breaches and cyberattacks.
Failure to do so can result in medical identity theft, insurance fraud, and other serious issues. What’s more, it can erode patient trust, lead to legal actions or hefty fines, and damage the organization’s reputation.
We all know that happy patients often recommend your services to others, bringing in more patients and increasing revenue. Without strong patient data security, you risk losing these benefits. Moreover, poor data security can disrupt coordinated care, making it harder to treat patients effectively.
Healthcare Data Security Standards To Protect Health Information
According to IBM, the cost of a healthcare data breach was $10.93 million in 2023. In response to these increasing costs and understanding the importance of data security in healthcare, international regulatory authorities have enacted stringent laws to ensure patient information remains secure. The two leading standards for patient data security are: 
1: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
HIPAA is a standard followed in the United States that was enacted in 1996. It sets national rules for the protection and privacy of health information. Healthcare providers must adhere to HIPAA best practices to ensure compliance and avoid security threats and legal penalties.
2: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
GDPR is applicable in Europe and was implemented in 2018. It provides guidelines on data privacy and applies to any organization handling the personal data of EU citizens. 
If your healthcare organization handles data from EU citizens, it is necessary to comply with GDPR regulations. With our comprehensive GDPR compliance checklist, you can ensure that you’re fully compliant and can protect patient health records.
5 Top Healthcare Data Security Challenges and Solutions
From patient records to medical billing details, every piece of information requires robust protection. Organizations often encounter common threats that can damage their reputation.
If you believe your organization is safe from healthcare data security challenges, think again. Understanding these hurdles and their solutions will help ensure the safety and privacy of your patient’s data. Here are the top 5 challenges of patient data security and their solutions:
1: Use of Outdated Healthcare Systems
Most healthcare organizations don’t bother to modernize their legacy healthcare systems. They keep using their outdated systems without knowing that they have become vulnerable to cyber threats and can no longer protect patient data. It can be due to budget constraints, but they must know that data breaches cost far more than upgrading to secure healthcare systems.
Solution
Healthcare providers must perform a technology audit to pinpoint legacy systems. They should modernize these healthcare systems using modern technologies by partnering with a reliable AI development company. Moreover, they can implement modern healthcare data protection solutions that will improve the security and integrity of their data security measures.
2: Insider Threats
Insider threats are among the most common healthcare data security challenges. Have you ever encountered a situation where an employee misused their access to sensitive patient information? If so, your organization is also vulnerable to insider threats.
Did you know these threats come not only from employees but also from contractors and vendors? This misuse can harm the organization in various ways. Insider threats can be classified into different types:

Negligent workers
Malicious insiders
Disgruntled employees or contractors
Third parties

 

Solution
Healthcare organizations can follow a number of ways to overcome insider threats. Firstly, they should conduct background checks of employees before hiring. Another way is by training employees and implementing strict access controls with strong password policies and two-factor authentication. Last but not least, they can continuously monitor employee and contractor activity to identify suspicious behavior.
3: Data Breaches
You will be surprised to know that the healthcare industry has the highest rate of data breaches compared to other sectors. Even though international standards like HIPAA have set strict rules to protect electronic health records (EHRs), many healthcare providers struggle to ensure effective security. 
It provides cybercriminals opportunities to exploit weaknesses through phishing attacks and ransomware. These attacks can lead to stealing critical patient data, such as medical histories.
Solution
Some solutions that will be effective for healthcare data protection include implementing robust access controls, such as two-factor authentication. Healthcare providers can also regularly monitor and update security systems to solve data breaches. Apart from the above two solutions, they can conduct regular security audits to ensure compliance with the latest security standards.
4: Improper Data Handling
Improper data handling is a common issue in the healthcare sector. Caregivers have to manage multiple tasks at a time, which can be overwhelming and lead to improper handling of sensitive patient health records. 
This improper handling increases the risks of misuse of information and failure to comply with healthcare data protection standards. Healthcare organizations must comply with international regulations to protect protected health information from unauthorized access and theft.
Solution
It is crucial for healthcare organizations to have security policies and procedures in place that align with international regulations. That’s one way to overcome this challenge. Another method is by training employees on HIPAA and GDPR compliance for efficient data privacy and security.
5: Unsecured Connected Medical Devices
Healthcare providers are increasingly inclined towards the IoMT development. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global IoMT market was valued at $47.32 billion in 2023. It is expected to reach an impressive $814.28 billion by 2032. 
Healthcare devices are interconnected to deliver exceptional patient care and achieve better patient outcomes. However, this increased connectivity also raises concerns about data protection in healthcare. These devices usually have weak security that allows cyberattackers to break into the systems and steal patient information. 
Solution
To overcome data security challenges in healthcare, providers must implement robust encryption methods. They can also use multi-factor authentication that adds an extra layer of protection to prevent unauthorized access. 
Healthcare data security is an ongoing process. It requires vigilance, regular updates, and a commitment to best practices. By addressing these challenges of data security in healthcare, organizations can protect patient data and maintain trust.
