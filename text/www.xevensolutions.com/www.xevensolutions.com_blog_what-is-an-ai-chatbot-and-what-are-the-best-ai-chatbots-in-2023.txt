Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the way we interact with technology. Among the many applications of AI, chatbots have emerged as a prominent and beneficial tool in various industries. In 2023, AI chatbots are making waves, enhancing customer experiences, streamlining processes, and offering solutions across diverse sectors. However, the success of an AI virtual assistant depends on the AI chatbot development company you choose. Therefore, it’s crucial to thoroughly assess the expertise and approach of companies before hiring. This article will explore what is an ai chatbot, its benefits, and the top 10 AI chatbots you should watch in 2023.
What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence (AI), a dynamic branch of computer science, focuses on developing intelligent agents and systems equipped to reason, learn, and act autonomously. This field has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, making it a crucial driver of innovation and transformation across numerous domains.
What are AI Chatbots?
An AI chatbot, short for Artificial Intelligence chatbot, represents a sophisticated computer program meticulously engineered to emulate conversations with human users. These ingenious digital entities have gained prominence due to their versatile applications across various domains, from customer service to education, entertainment, and data collection. 
Difference between a chatbot and conversational AI
A chatbot is a type of conversational AI, but the two terms are not synonymous. Chatbots are typically rule-based systems, while conversational AI systems can learn and adapt over time. Conversational AI systems are also more likely to be able to understand and respond to complex questions and requests.
Chatbots vs. Conversational AI

While chatbots and conversational AI are often used interchangeably, there are key differences: –

Chatbots are AI-powered software applications for conversational interfaces via text or voice. Their capabilities are narrow and focused on specific tasks.
Conversational AI refers to a broader category of any system that can converse with humans in a natural language. It aims to achieve human-level communication abilities across multiple domains.
Chatbots are designed for well-defined use cases and narrow conversations within a particular domain like customer service, healthcare, e-commerce, etc.
Conversational AI systems are more versatile and can understand broader contexts for flexible conversations on any topic using their general knowledge and reasoning abilities.

What are the Use Cases of AI Chatbots?
AI chatbots can be used for a variety of purposes, including: –

Chatbots can also provide 24/7 support, which can be especially helpful for businesses operating in multiple time zones.
Sales and marketing:
Chatbots can generate leads, qualify prospects, and answer sales questions. For example, a chatbot on a company’s website can greet visitors and ask them questions to determine their interest in its products or services. If the visitor is interested, the chatbot can collect their contact information and pass it on to a sales representative. Chatbots can also be used to send personalized marketing messages to potential customers.
Education: 
Chatbots can provide educational content and answer students’ questions. For example, a chatbot could teach students about a particular subject, such as math or science. Chatbots could also be used to provide students with personalized feedback on their work.
Entertainment: 
Chatbots can be used to create games, tell stories, and provide other forms of entertainment. For example, some chatbots can play chess, tell jokes, and generate creative text formats, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, emails, letters, etc.
Data collection:
Chatbots can collect user data, such as feedback, demographics, and preferences. This data can be used to improve products and services, personalize marketing campaigns, and better understand customer needs.
