In recent times, the medical industry has seen the adoption of modern technologies and solutions to meet their financial and patient care goals. Two prominent healthcare AI solutions that every provider has adopted are electronic health record (EHR) and electronic medical record (EMR) software solutions. These solutions have become a necessity for serving patient needs and meeting your objectives.
Xeven Solutions, as a top EHR/EMR software provider, understands your business requirements and delivers a custom healthcare solution to help you raise healthcare delivery standards. This article will help you explore the top features and modules of EHR/EMR software Xeven Solutions offer and the benefits of collaborating with them, so make sure to read through to the end.
Top EMR/EHR Modules Xeven Solutions Provide
Xeven Solutions prioritizes delivering meaningful healthcare AI solutions that are fit for your business needs rather than merely pushing our services and products. We deliver custom EHR and EMR software solutions with the right modules and features that not only improve your organizational workflow but also help you serve patients’ needs better. Let’s explore some of the many top modules of EHR/EMR solutions we offer:
1. Patient Information Management
Every second counts in the healthcare industry. A delay in access to essential patient health information can lead to unfortunate scenarios. It can harm your organizational reputation and can cost you patients’ trust. Xeven Solutions helps you maintain your organizational integrity and earn more patients by simplifying patient records management.
We centralize comprehensive patient information, including demographics, treatment histories, vital signs, etc, in a single place. It allows healthcare providers like you to quickly and easily access the required patient information to start treatment. Medical professionals can make data-driven decisions that result in better patient outcomes.
2. Appointment Scheduling

As a healthcare startup, it is a must for you to know what patients prefer. According to Zippia, 67% of patients prefer online booking. Moreover, more than half of Gen X and Millennials say that they are likely to switch to healthcare providers that offer the convenience of online appointment booking.
Xeven Solutions delivers an appointment scheduling module in EHR/EMR software that makes it easy for providers and patients to schedule, manage, and reschedule appointments. Moreover, patients and providers receive reminders and are notified in case of any changes to the appointment.
3. E-Prescriptions

It is shocking to know that medication errors are one of the leading causes of death in the US. An NCBI report reveals that medication errors lead to 7000 to 9000 American deaths each year. Xeven Solutions helps eliminate prescription errors by enabling healthcare providers to prescribe drugs electronically.
These e-prescriptions are sent directly to the pharmacies from where patients can get their medications. The move away from handwritten prescriptions means there are no risks of drug interactions and no more problems with unreadable handwriting. Moreover, patients can request refills using the healthcare solution.
4. Revenue Cycle Management
Revenue cycle management is one of the most essential components of our EHR/EMR software solutions. A Becker’s Hospital Review reveals that nearly 80% of all medical bills contain errors. Xeven Solutions helps providers gain financial stability and reduce medical billing errors by automating everything from billing to claim processing.
Healthcare providers can verify insurance eligibility, charge patients for the services or treatments they receive, and generate invoices for patients. This module also helps reduce outstanding payments and manage payment plans.
5. Integration with Laboratories & Telemedicine
Another crucial module that Xeven Solutions EHR/EMR solution provides is seamless integration with laboratories and telemedicine solutions. These integrations help healthcare providers raise the healthcare delivery standards and meet patients’ needs better. 
The integration with labs allows caregivers to track and receive patient test results conveniently, which helps in making well-informed decisions. The sharing of data becomes easy between healthcare providers and labs, which ensures timely test orders and results. On the other hand, the integration with telemedicine software allows providers to engage in one-to-one appointments with patients remotely. It eliminates the need for in-person visits and leads to saving costs.
What benefits of EHR/EMR software development can you expect for your healthcare startup?
Xeven Solutions has helped businesses of all sizes from around the globe to tap into the numerous benefits of EHR/EMR software solutions. Here are some notable benefits healthcare providers mention when talking about how EHR/EMR software development helped their practice:
1. Improve Operational Efficiency
Xeven Solutions EMR/EHR software solutions help healthcare startups achieve efficiency in their daily tasks. With our solutions, caregivers can eliminate the hassle of managing stacks of papers and files and store every essential information digitally in a single place. 
Healthcare professionals can quickly access and manage protected health information that helps in better decision-making. That’s not all; these systems also help in automating various administrative tasks, including e-prescription management and appointment scheduling. This automation helps to reduce the burden on professionals and stay focused on delivering high-quality patient care.
2. Better Patient Care Quality
Besides financial goals, the primary mission of healthcare providers is to deliver compassionate patient care to meet their needs. However, for some reason, healthcare startups are still relying on outdated systems or traditional methods of delivering care.

It’s well-known that satisfied patients stay loyal and help to attract new patients. So, why not adopt the solutions they believe improve the quality of care? A recent report reveals that 45% of patients have experienced improved care quality due to EHR system adoption by their healthcare providers.
Xeven Solutions EHR/EMR development services help you meet your financial targets while enhancing patient care. Our solutions provide timely access to comprehensive patient health records that help minimize delays in delivering personalized care to patients. Moreover, our systems keep caregivers informed about the patient’s vital signs and allergies so they can prescribe drugs that don’t react.
3. Slash Costs & Increase Revenue
Xeven Solutions EHR/EMR software solutions help healthcare providers improve their revenue and cut costs. I know it is hard to believe that a single solution can deliver so many benefits, but it’s true. Our well-versed developers deliver healthcare information systems that automate billing and coding tasks that lead to faster reimbursements and fewer claim denials.
The shift from paper records to a modern health EHR/EMR system cuts down on costs associated with paper and storage. The automation of administrative tasks frees up medical staff and enables them to serve more patients, which results in more revenue. Moreover, equipment is utilized where they are needed the most, thus reducing unnecessary equipment costs.
4. Regulatory Compliance & Security
As a leading healthcare AI development company, Xeven Solutions understands the strict laws and regulatory challenges that the healthcare industry must adhere to. A slight data breach can result in heavy fines and even imprisonment.
Our veteran EHR/EMR experts deliver secure solutions that comply with HIPAA and GDPR regulations. This compliance not only protects patient data, but also helps to maintain organizational reputation and prevent substantial financial loss. It gives healthcare startups like you peace of mind and allows them to focus on more strategic tasks.
What is the difference between EHR and EMR software solutions? What’s the Best Fit for Your Practice?
By now, most of you must be questioning yourself, “Is EHR software the same as EMR? Or which one is best suited for your medical practice?” Curious minds, let me satisfy your curiosity. The simple answer is no, they are not the same. 
Undoubtedly, their goal is to replace paper health records and digitize them, but they differ in many ways. Here are some differences that will help you choose the best fit for your practice:

It is hard to choose between the two as both have their own benefits that no one can deny. What you should choose depends on the challenge you want to address or the specific goals you want to achieve. If you’re still unsure which one to choose, I suggest consulting free with EHR/EMR software development experts to discuss your needs and get expert advice.
What is the cost of developing EHR/EMR software solutions?
The cost of EHR/EMR software development can range between $40,000 to $350,000. However, it is crucial to understand that the cost can vary depending on various factors. It can be your specific requirements, the tools and technologies used, the region of the development company, compliance, and ongoing maintenance. The best way to get an estimate for your project is to schedule a free discovery call with a reliable EHR/EMR software development company.
