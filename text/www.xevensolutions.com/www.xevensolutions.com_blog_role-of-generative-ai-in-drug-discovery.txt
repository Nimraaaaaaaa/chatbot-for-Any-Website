1: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Generative Adversarial Networks consist of two neural networks. One is a generator, and the other is a discriminator. As the name suggests, the job of the generator is to create new synthetical data. On the other hand, discriminators separate the real data from the generated data. They are trained in a competitive manner so they can improve over time. 
In drug discovery, the generator builds molecular structures while the discriminator network evaluates their authenticity. It results in the generation of realistic and novel molecules.
2: Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is another generative AI in drug discovery technique in which the model learns by interacting with the environment. It works on a reward-punishment paradigm where the agent learns from the feedback and takes suitable actions that will lead to achieving final outcomes. 
In drug discovery, it is used to train a model that helps to optimize molecular structures based on desired properties.
3: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural Language Processing is a generative AI drug discovery technique that helps to extract and understand information from textual data. It helps in target identification, drug repurposing, and knowledge extraction to speed up the drug discovery process.
Natural language processing enables researchers to get valuable insights from the textual data that will aid in advancing pharmaceutical research and enhancing patient outcomes.

Moreover, it increases the likelihood of discovering impactful and powerful compounds deserving of further development and experimental validation.
Real-world Example
Atomwise project about AI molecule screening significantly speeds up the drug discovery and generation process. They successfully identified molecules that act as an inhibitor to the Ebola virus. It substantially reduces the time required for drug discovery by eliminating the need for time-consuming laboratory tests.
3: Compound Library Expansion
Compound library expansion exemplifies the massive role of generative AI in drug discovery. It revolutionizes drug discovery by suggesting modifications to known compounds, enhancing their efficacy and safety. It diversifies compound libraries by leveraging machine learning and analyzing molecular structures. Researchers can then synthesize and test these variations, which helps to save time and resources. This iterative process continually refines the library and accelerates the discovery of effective treatments.
Real-world Example
Aptuit has claimed that they utilize generative AI to expand compound libraries for drug discovery. These companies have generated hundreds of compounds with enhanced properties by analyzing and modifying the existing molecules.
4: Offer Personalized Treatment
Generative AI aids in developing personalized medicines by taking into account individual patient characteristics. It aids in developing drugs that are more efficient and with no side effects. Moreover, if there is any disease with limited data available, generative AI assists by providing invaluable insights from the limited data.
Real-world Example
MIT researchers developed a new antibiotic using generative AI that can kill a drug-resistant bacterium that leads to over 10000 deaths in the US every year. It indicates that gen AI in healthcare can be used to generate novel molecules or compounds to provide a tailored solution.
