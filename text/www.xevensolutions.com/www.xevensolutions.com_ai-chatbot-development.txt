Frequently Asked Questions 



 

What are AI chatbots?  


                                        AI chatbots are artificial intelligence (AI) applications that can converse with humans like a real person would. Through natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies, chatbots understand what users say and can respond appropriately. They are designed to have conversations via text or voice to inform users.                                    




What is conversational AI?  


                                        Conversational AI is the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with conversations between humans and AI assistants, chatbots, or intelligent agents using natural language. The goal is to make interactions as close to everyday human-to-human conversations as possible by following speech patterns and understanding user intent.

During interactions, the chatbot analyzes user inputs, matches them to its training, and responds based on the highest probability answer. It gets smarter over time by learning from new conversations.
