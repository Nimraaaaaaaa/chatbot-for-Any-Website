Computer Vision Development Process 







 



 



							Step 1						



Data Collection and Preprocessing 



Developing computer vision starts with this. The data needed to train the computer vision model must be gathered and prepared. Tasks like data labeling, cleaning, and augmentation fall under this category. 







 



							Step 2						



 



Model Development 



Creating a computer vision model is the next step once the data has been gathered and preprocessed. This entails choosing the exemplary deep learning architecture and adjusting the hyperparameters to achieve the best performance. 







 



							Step 3						



 



Model Training and Evaluation 



The next step is to train the model using the preprocessed data. The model is trained by adjusting the neural network weights to minimize the error between the predicted and actual outputs. 







 



							Step 4						



Deployment 



The final step is to deploy the model in a production environment. It entails incorporating the model into a program or system. This ensures it can handle fresh data inputs and produce precise outputs.
