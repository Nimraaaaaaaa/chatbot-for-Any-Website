Frequently Asked Questions 



 

What does HIPAA compliance cover?   


                                        HIPAA compliance covers many privacy and security measures for protecting patients' protected health information (PHI). This includes requirements around how PHI is used, disclosed, and requested by healthcare providers and their business associates.
                                    




What are the different types of HIPAA compliance?  


                                        There are administrative, physical, and technical types of HIPAA compliance. Administration involves policies and procedures for privacy, security, and breach notification. Physical requires safeguarding paper files and office access. Technical focuses on encryption, authentication, and access controls for electronic PHI.                                    




What is the most serious HIPAA violation?  


                                        The most serious HIPAA violation would be intentionally or knowingly using or disclosing PHI in an unpermitted manner. This could result in civil and criminal penalties from regulators. However, most organizations don't want to be non-compliant - they're looking for solutions to help them comply efficiently.                                    




Is HIPAA compliance difficult and expensive?  


                                        For some organizations, achieving Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance requires an investment of time and resources. However, the right solutions and approach can be relatively easy and inexpensive. Many vendors now offer HIPAA compliance as a service with tools that make the process streamlined and affordable.                                    




What are HIPAA compliance rules?   


                                        The key HIPAA rules relate to privacy, security, breach notification, and standard transactions. The Privacy Rule establishes patients' rights over their data, and what uses and disclosures require authorization. The Security Rule sets technical, physical, and administrative standards. And Breach Notification requires reporting certain data breaches. Covered entities need to understand these rules and have controls addressing each area.
