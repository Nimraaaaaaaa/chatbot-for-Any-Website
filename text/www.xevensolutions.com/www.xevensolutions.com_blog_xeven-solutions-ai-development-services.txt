How can AI be used in healthcare?

AI use cases in healthcare are numerous, ranging from AI chatbot solutions to medical imaging. However, for people who aren’t familiar with the applications of AI in healthcare, we will discuss some pivotal AI applications in healthcare that are:
1.Chatbots
AI-powered chatbots are one of the most pivotal use cases of AI in healthcare. They are available 24/7 to provide instant support and care to patients. These chatbots ask patients questions to analyze their symptoms and provide personalized advice to improve their health. 
Moreover, these intelligent chatbots can book appointments, reduce the administrative burden, and guide patients about medicines’ potential benefits and side effects.
2.Remote Patient Monitoring
There might arise some scenarios where it is not possible for doctors or patients to be physically available at the hospital. Telemedicine emerges as a convenient solution for this healthcare concern. 
Telemedicine applications allow doctors to analyze patient conditions and provide real-time recommendations remotely. It significantly improves the quality of healthcare services and makes healthcare delivery more efficient.
