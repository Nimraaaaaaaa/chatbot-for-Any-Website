Artificial intelligence is the most innovative technology of the 21st century. Several industries, including finance, e-commerce, etc., have experienced its transformative impact. Not only these industries, but it has started reshaping the healthcare industry recently. The advantages of AI in healthcare are enormous. Therefore, businesses are investing heavily in this technology.
According to Statista, the global healthcare AI market will be worth $188 billion by 2030. This massive surge in the AI healthcare market indicates the interest of businesses in leveraging the benefits of AI in medicine. 
Today, we will discuss the top 7 medical advantages of AI in healthcare, along with application examples on how AI is used in medical field. But before that, let’s have a look at the challenges faced by healthcare organizations.

Challenges Faced by Healthcare Companies
Healthcare companies have faced several challenges that hinder their ability to devote full attention to patient care. It was mainly because of the lack of technological advancements in the sector. Some of the challenges faced by companies in medicine sector were:
Compliance Complexities: Pharmaceutical companies face intricate global regulations from entities like the FDA, making compliance for drug approval and safety crucial yet challenging.
Process Pitfalls: As companies have to rely on manual data entry, it is prone to errors that can impact patient safety and the integrity of medical organizations. 
Efficiency Constraints: Productivity is constrained due to time-consuming manual processes and procedures. 
Security: Old paper records and outdated electronic systems lack sufficient security, which risks patient data breaches. Traditional methods may not meet modern security standards.
Real-time Insights Gap: Organizations in the past didn’t have access to real-time patient data, which acts as a blockage in handling critical situations and impacts their efficiency.

Top 7 Medical Advantages of AI in Healthcare
AI in medicine has benefits for both healthcare providers and patients alike. It helps doctors by reducing the administrative burden and improving patient care. Some AI in healthcare examples include public health, AI-powered diagnosis, etc. 
These AI applications in medical field have transformed the way healthcare is delivered. Here are the top 7 medical advantages of AI in healthcare:

1: Improved Diagnostics
Improved diagnostics is one of the major advantages of Gen AI in healthcare. AI algorithms have the ability to analyze CT scans and other medical imaging to detect any abnormalities more precisely. It helps to detect any diseases earlier to improve patient care and reduce the healthcare cost that comes with delayed disease detection.
2: Personalized Medicine
The genetics of humans vary from person to person. So, it necessitates personalized treatment for each individual. 
AI plays a crucial role in healthcare through the development of personalized medicines. It helps healthcare providers to analyze patients’ characteristics and a large data set to provide suitable treatment plans tailored to each patient. It significantly improves the rate at which patients are cured and hinders any potential negative impacts. 
3: Healthcare Fraud Detection
Fraud has been there in every industry and healthcare is no exception. Fraud detection is one of the most important AI applications in medical field. AI algorithms detect any suspicious or unusual patterns and identify any inconsistencies in billings and fraudulent activities. It helps to save a massive amount of money in the healthcare system. 
4: Faster Drug Discovery
AI expedites the process of drug discovery and development by detecting the potential drug candidates quickly and optimizing the drug development processes. 
Machine learning algorithms analyze vast data sets and simulate chemical reactions. It helps drug development researchers in designing and introducing drugs much faster. Doing so contributes to addressing unmet medical needs and improving patient care.
5: Electronic Health Record Management
One of the most crucial advantages of AI in healthcare is the management of Electronic Health Records (EHR). Natural language processing, which is a branch of artificial intelligence, helps to extract meaningful information from unorganized clinical data. It helps to streamline the documentation process and makes it easier for healthcare providers to access vital information. 
6: Round-the-Clock Availability
Virtual assistants or AI chatbots offer numerous benefits in healthcare. They aid in handling administrative tasks, provide responses to patient queries, and offer 24/7 availability for prompt replies. These AI virtual assistants help doctors stay more focused on patient care, which enhances the patient experience and engagement.
7: Remote Patient Monitoring & Telemedicine
Remote patient monitoring is another benefit of AI in healthcare. With the help of IoT, healthcare providers have access to real-time patient data due to interconnected devices. It empowers clinicians to monitor patients’ conditions remotely.
Telemedicine platforms also enable virtual healthcare analysis that helps to improve patient care by reducing the need to visit hospitals regularly.

What is the future of AI in Healthcare?

Artificial intelligence holds a bright future as its applications are continuously evolving in the healthcare industry. It has the potential to revolutionize patient care by improved robotic surgery, earlier disease diagnosis, remote monitoring, etc. 
In the near future, machines will be assisting healthcare providers in providing better patient care by streamlining processes and enabling more personalized treatment plans.
As the application of AI in healthcare continues to grow, we will see even more advancements in healthcare to make life better for many worldwide. However, it is necessary to address the potential concerns associated with it to realize the advantages of AI in healthcare fully.
Conclusion
The implementation of AI in healthcare and medicine has helped to increase healthcare providers’ efficiency and is a significant shift towards a brighter future. No doubt, there are several critical advantages of AI in healthcare. However, it is imperative to remain vigilant of the potential risks that come with the implementation of AI in healthcare. 
We can ensure that AI continues to drive positive change in healthcare by understanding the good AI brings and being careful about ethical concerns.
