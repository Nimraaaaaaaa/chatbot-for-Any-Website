Did you recently come to know about generative AI? You’re not alone. Hundreds of thousands of young minds have come to know about generative AI after the introduction of ChatGPT. Since then, it has started finding its footing in the mainstream.
Several well-known firms like Forbes, Gartner, and McKinsey have made some bold predictions about the future of generative AI. Gartner projects that 75% of businesses will use generative AI to create synthetic customer data for testing by 2026, up from less than 5% in 2023. McKinsey did a survey in mid-2024 and found out that 65% of organizations are regularly using generative AI, almost twice as many as just 10 months earlier.

It will help you understand how you can use generative AI in your specific industry.

Generative AI, or Gen AI, is a kind of artificial intelligence. It helps users do multiple tasks, such as generating various types of content like texts, audio, and visuals, summarizing content, and improving customer service as per the user prompts. 
Generative AI relies on foundation models to perform these and many other tasks. These models understand user input and provide the best possible responses. You can also train these models on the datasets relevant to your business.

Generative AI use cases in healthcare can change the way healthcare professionals carry out processes. It’s like giving healthcare professionals an extra pair of hands to manage administrative hassles and focus on high-value tasks.

Drug discovery is one of the most common generative AI use cases for pharmaceuticals. Gen AI is shaking up drug discovery big time. It takes years of research down to months.

5: Gaming
The level of creativity and realism that generative AI brings to the gaming industry is hard to ignore. Characters aren’t just static anymore—they breathe life into the games. Their personalities, their reactions, and even the way they look are portrayed in ways that make everything feel alive.


Character Creation
