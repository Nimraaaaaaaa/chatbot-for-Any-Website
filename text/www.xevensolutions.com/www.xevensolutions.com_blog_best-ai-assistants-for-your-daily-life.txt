Top 5 Best AI Assistants for Your Daily Life
1-Google Assistant
When it comes to the best AI personal assistant, no other AI tool can replace Google Assistant. 
From seamless integration with Google services to multi-language support and automating multiple tasks with a single command to seamlessly respond to voice-activated commands, Google Assistant stands out as a versatile AI personal assistant.

In addition, it can summarize web pages and documents, automate routine processes, and translate between languages, making it one of the best virtual AI assistants. 
Its understanding of context is impressive compared to other AI assistants, like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri, which don’t remember the previous question to respond to follow-up inquiries.
 It is free to use with many functionalities, while its pro version costs $20 per month with a 30-day free trial.

5-Bixby

Samsung’s Bixby is a voice assistant for the company’s smartphones and allows users to control devices hand-free through voice commands. 
It can send text messages, screen phone calls, check the weather forecast, and even allow you to control your camera hand-free and launch apps. 
Bixby is often compared with other voice assistants, such as Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa due to its impressive features. 
For instance, it handles on-device processing for basic voice commands. It enables the voice assistant to work offline and process many everyday commands without internet connectivity. 
What’s more? It can understand confusing or incomplete voice commands and ask for more details to determine the right action to take.     
Pros

Bilingual mode
Hands-free control of various Samsung devices
Context-rich conversation and cognitive tolerance

Cons

Device integration is limited to only Samsung devices

The Bottom Line:

From composing your emails to managing your day-to-day tasks and recording and transcribing meetings to smart home integration, AI personal assistants save time and manage your day more efficiently.
The key to success with AI assistants is to view them as collaborators, not replacements.
