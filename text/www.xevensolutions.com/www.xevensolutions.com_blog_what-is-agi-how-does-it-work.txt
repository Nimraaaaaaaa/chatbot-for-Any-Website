The world has seen a rapid adoption of artificial intelligence in the past few years. It is because of its potential to create a positive impact on businesses worldwide. Many of you might be familiar with cutting-edge technologies, including AI and generative AI, but are you familiar with artificial general intelligence (AGI)?
You might get confused between generative AI and artificial general intelligence because of their almost similar names, but these are totally different concepts. AGI is the next level of artificial intelligence that presents numerous untapped opportunities. However, generative AI can produce content of any type, depending on training data.
Tech enthusiasts might already be familiar with the concept of AGI. Still, for people who are new to this terminology, we have got you covered with our detailed guide about “What is artificial general intelligence, how it works, and the difference between AI and AGI.”
What is artificial general intelligence (AGI)?

AGI is the branch of theoretical artificial intelligence research that enables software systems to perform tasks irrespective of the trained dataset. It can mimic human intelligence and self-learn to perform any task that a human can perform.
Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is considered a strong AI. What does it mean? It indicates that AGI systems are able to solve complex problems of different domains as opposed to narrow AI that only operates within set parameters and is only able to solve specific problems.
How does artificial general intelligence work?
Engineers and scientists are on the verge of taking AI solutions to one level ahead. They want to introduce human intelligence into computer programs so that they can exceed human thinking abilities and handle situations with even more diligence.
Ideas from different fields are being blended to create AGI systems. Scientists are looking at how our brains work, how computers learn by themselves, and even how computer programs can do things in the real world.
There are no existing AGI systems for now, but scientists are continuously experimenting to develop AGI systems that will have the ability to self-learn, self-control, and provide solutions to complex problems that they aren’t familiar with at the time of their creation. These systems will have the ability to process vast amounts of data quickly.
Approaches to Artificial General Intelligence Research

Now that we have discussed what is AGI artificial intelligence and how it works, it is time to discuss the types of AGI approaches. 
Scientists and researchers are looking for different ways to achieve AGI systems. They are experimenting with different technologies to do so. They have proposed several research methods that will help to achieve AGI systems. These include:
1.Symbolic
The symbolic research approach to achieving AGI refers to machines that work on logic, symbols, and a set of rules to simulate human cognition. Machines are allowed to manipulate the pieces of symbols fed to them explicitly to perform tasks.
2.Emergentist
The human brain’s neural networks inspire the emergentist approach. It focuses on the concept that brain neurons change their path when humans interact with external agents. So, if the same thing is achieved in machines, they can perform tasks like humans.
3.Hybrid
A hybrid approach is a combination of symbolic and neural network approaches. It means picking parts of different methods that work best and building a single combined system that will eventually be stronger than the best parts from different methods. This approach will overcome the limitations of each technique.
4.Universalist
The universalist approach aims to explain intelligence everywhere. It focuses on finding the core mathematical principles behind general intelligence. Once researchers figure out these principles theoretically, they can use them to create AGI solutions in real life.
Are There Any Artificial General Intelligence Examples?
The simple answer to this question is No. There are no systems available as of today that can achieve the status of AGI systems. Some researchers say that GPT-4 can be the AGI system as it can solve queries of any complexity and can provide content of any kind. However, it is not true, as the CEO of GPT-4 himself says that it is not even close to the AGI model.
In the near future, it is very much possible that we will have a list of AGI systems that will act as an assistant to humans and transform how we do tasks. 
AGI vs. AI: The Core Difference
Artificial intelligence is an umbrella term that encompasses artificial general intelligence. Both are related to each other but are different concepts in terms of what they do:

AI systems are designed to perform a task based on the training data. In contrast, AGI systems understand, learn, and solve complex problems without the need for human intervention. AGI systems are equally smart as humans.
AI systems have a limited scope, which means they perform a specific task, while AGI systems have a broader scope, meaning they can solve multiple tasks from a variety of domains.
AI systems are available for everyone to use. In contrast, AGI systems don’t exist for now as scientists and engineers are still working to achieve the level of human cognitive ability in machines.

What is artificial super intelligence?

Artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a hypothetical system that exceeds human intelligence in every aspect. It is considered the most advanced form of artificial intelligence because of its ability to self-learn and make its own decisions. 
Scientists are looking for ways to first achieve AGI systems because achieving superintelligence systems isn’t possible without them. Once achieved, the impact of ASI will revolutionize every industry, including healthcare, finance, agriculture, real estate, etc.
What is the future of AGI?
The future of AGI is an ardent mystery. Some researchers debate that we will achieve AGI within the next decade, while others believe that it is not possible to achieve AGI. However, the year we achieved AGI will transform the methods of doing things completely. 
A notable name that believes that AGI solutions will be part of this world is Ray Kurzweil, who is Google’s Director of Engineering. He believes that AGI will be achieved by 2029 and artificial superintelligence systems will be among us by 2045.
In contrast, Goertzel, who is an AI researcher and computer scientist, says that it is hard to analyze how close we are to AGI because there are lots of ways to get there. He says there is no clear theory for AGI. Instead, it is a combination of different ideas that sometimes work together and sometimes don’t.
Elon Musk believes that AGI will be a big threat to human existence. He says that putting efforts into achieving AGI systems is like “summoning the demon.”
Conclusion
Today, we can see AI transforming each aspect of human lives. Not only does it have an impact on an individual level but also on the business or industrial levels. AGI is an exciting hypothetical concept that scientists are working hard to bring into reality. Once they succeed in their efforts, we can see further advancements in every field.
However, with AGI comes several risks as they can act like a human and don’t require any manual intervention, so achieving that level of AI can be dangerous as well if ethical considerations are not met. 
We believe that our guide about what is artificial general intelligence will help you get familiar with this exciting concept and know what it can do for humans.
